To use Serilog to create logs in a text file in a console application, you can follow these steps:

Install the Serilog and Serilog.Sinks.File packages from NuGet.

In your console application, add the following using statements at the top of your C# file

using Serilog;
using Serilog.Events;
using Serilog.Sinks.File;


Initialize Serilog in your application by configuring the logger with the desired settings. For example, to create a logger that writes logs to a text file, you can use the following code:

Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug()
    .WriteTo.File("logs.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger();

how to use serilog to create logsin TXT file in console application

To use Serilog to create logs in a text file in a console application, you can follow these steps:

Install the Serilog and Serilog.Sinks.File packages from NuGet.

In your console application, add the following using statements at the top of your C# file:

csharp
Copy code
using Serilog;
using Serilog.Events;
using Serilog.Sinks.File;
Initialize Serilog in your application by configuring the logger with the desired settings. For example, to create a logger that writes logs to a text file, you can use the following code:

csharp
Copy code
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug()
    .WriteTo.File("logs.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
    .CreateLogger();
In this example, the MinimumLevel property sets the minimum log level to Debug (you can adjust this to a different level, such as Information or Warning, depending on your needs). The WriteTo method specifies that logs should be written to a text file named "logs.txt", and the rollingInterval parameter specifies that the file should roll over to a new file each day.

Use the logger to write logs in your console application. For example, you can write a log statement like this:

Log.Information("This is an informational message.");


This will write a log entry to the text file with the message "This is an informational message." and the log level set to Information.

Finally, make sure to dispose of the logger when your application exits by calling Log.CloseAndFlush(). This will ensure that all logs are written to the text file before the application exits.



static void Main(string[] args)
{
    // Initialize Serilog logger
    Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
        .MinimumLevel.Debug()
        .WriteTo.File("logs.txt", rollingInterval: RollingInterval.Day)
        .CreateLogger();

    // Write some log messages
    Log.Information("Application starting up.");
    Log.Debug("Debug message.");
    Log.Warning("Warning message.");
    Log.Error("Error message.");

    // Dispose of the logger
    Log.CloseAndFlush();
}



With these steps, you should be able to use Serilog to create logs in a text file in your console application.
