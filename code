Volunteer Stall Activities.


shabarinathans@yahoo.co.in
We have a stall for volunteering activities(we do environment, education, youth mentoring) in one technology conference . 
Now question is we need to engage the participants with some activities. What we can do? Like quiz means what questions we can ask 

Great to hear that you are looking for engaging activities to promote your volunteering activities at the technology conference. Here are a few ideas for you:

Trivia Quiz: Create a fun trivia quiz with questions related to the environment, education, and youth mentoring. You could include questions about famous environmentalists, education systems around the world, and famous mentors in history. You can also offer small prizes to the winners.

Interactive Pledge Board: Set up an interactive pledge board where participants can make a commitment to take some action for the environment, education, or mentoring. You can provide sticky notes and markers for them to write down their pledges and stick them on the board. This will not only engage participants but also create a sense of community and shared purpose.

Hands-On Activities: You can also offer hands-on activities, such as making seed bombs to promote gardening, creating DIY notebooks from recycled materials, or even simple coding activities for children. These activities will give participants a chance to learn and engage with your cause in a fun and interactive way.

Social Media Campaign: Set up a social media campaign and encourage participants to share photos or videos of themselves engaging in your activities. You can offer a prize for the most creative or inspiring post, and this will also help to spread the word about your volunteering activities.

Speed Mentoring Sessions: If you are offering youth mentoring activities, you could organize speed mentoring sessions where participants can spend a few minutes talking with experienced mentors from your organization. This will give them a chance to learn about the benefits of mentoring and gain insights into your organization's work.

I hope these ideas help you create engaging activities for your volunteering stall at the technology conference!
