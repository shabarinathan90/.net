    // Write some We will tag you with a school girl. You have to do at least 3 phone call sessions. Every session is just for 30 to 45 mins. 



You will teach topics like '10 tips to prepare for success,' which will help the girl child improve at a personal level and in career too. We will share you the curriculum to teach. If you wish, you can aditionally do 2 optional sessions. 



Note: We will do a Zoom Orientation to explain the activity. Open to only Tamil speaking female volunteers (Check Eligibility below).
