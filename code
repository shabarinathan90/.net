The second event is focused on teaching time management strategies and techniques that will help college students balance their academic, social, and personal commitments. Time management is a vital skill that will serve students well throughout their lives, and we believe that this event will be especially beneficial for those who struggle with balancing their priorities.

However, we have received very few nominations from colleagues, and we need your help to spread the word about these events to your team members. We would be grateful if you could encourage your colleagues to register for these events and help us make them a success.

We are confident that these events will help students develop important skills that will serve them well throughout their lives, and we appreciate your support in making them a success. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.
