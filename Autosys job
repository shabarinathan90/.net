Santhmurthy from BACI and I conducted a site visit to RRD Chennai on April 25th, where we engaged with the team and had the opportunity to interface with RRD Management. We were pleased with the warm reception and hospitality extended to us. It was valuable to meet face-to-face with the team with whom we collaborate remotely on a daily basis. Additionally, we had the pleasure of meeting the RRD Onsite member. During our interaction, we expressed our appreciation for the team's consistent contributions to our Research business. We mutually agreed to schedule bi-weekly Webex meetings to address any operational challenges or concerns, ensuring streamlined communication and alignment between our teams.






Therefore, we have some prerequisites in place to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of this event:

Proficiency in Tamil language is a must, as many of the documents will be in Tamil.
Volunteers are required to arrive promptly at their registered slots, five minutes before the event start time.
Each volunteer should register for only one slot. This is intentionally designed to ensure that each application form is read by three different volunteers, thus providing a fair opportunity to the deserving students.
