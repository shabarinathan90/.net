In addition to my ongoing efforts with Nizhal and other initiatives, I have had the opportunity to engage in several other meaningful volunteer experiences.

During challenging times, I joined a team to distribute meals to underprivileged communities, offering not just sustenance but also hope and comfort. The gratitude and relief in the faces of those we served were incredibly moving, reminding me of the profound impact of small acts of kindness.

Another rewarding experience was guiding a group of college students in their volunteering efforts.

**The Impact of My Volunteer Work**

As a dedicated volunteer, I am deeply proud and fulfilled by the meaningful impact I've made since joining the bank in 2020. Initially, I engaged in virtual volunteering due to pandemic restrictions, which ignited a strong desire to make a difference. After relocating to Chennai, I shifted to on-field events, focusing on tree plantation drives, supporting special kids, and assisting senior citizens.

My work with Nizhal, a non-profit trust, has been especially rewarding. Weekly, I participate in activities at Nizhal Tree Park, including gardening, cleaning, watering trees, and managing waste. These efforts help maintain green spaces that enhance the environment and provide a sanctuary for the community.

I have also led teams in mapping vulnerable areas through Missing Maps, which helps humanitarian organizations deliver aid more effectively in crisis situations. This critical work ensures that those in need receive timely assistance.

In addition to environmental efforts, I have made a positive impact in education. I’ve provided scribe services for visually impaired students, offering support with exams and assignments, and have also offered career guidance, created educational materials, and taught subjects like math to children. My support extends to events for persons with disabilities, promoting their empowerment and inclusion.

My contributions to community development include beach cleanups, visiting old age homes, and distributing school supplies. I’ve also assisted underprivileged students with resume preparation, communication skills training, mock interviews, and career exploration.

Event organization has been another key area of my volunteering. I’ve coordinated various events, including festivals, music and dance fests, sports days, award functions, and meetings for the visually impaired. I’ve also conducted virtual sessions on spoken English and career exploration.

Key highlights of my volunteering include:

- At Nizhal, we planted over 75 saplings last year and maintain trees at various locations: Velachery (150+), Taramani (180+), Perungudi (70+), and Kotturpuram (2000+). Kotturpuram features 200+ unique species, creating a vibrant biodiversity hub.
- Supported 200+ women students through educational activities.
- Partnered with NGO Thuvakkam for a tree plantation drive, planting 1000 indigenous saplings.
- During a beach cleanup, our team collected over 100 kg of waste, contributing to a cleaner environment.
- Engaged with special needs children in sports, education, and festivals, promoting their development.
- Conducted yoga activities at SOS Children's Village, engaging around 50 children.
- Participated in the Agaram-Vidhai 2024 program, reviewing 2,500 student applications with 130 volunteers to provide academic and professional opportunities.
- Supported 50 visually impaired candidates in a TNSPC mock exam.
- Empowered 100+ special needs individuals through various initiatives.
- Organized community development and skill-building events.
- Supported various NGOs like Chennai Volunteers, Anudip Foundation, Humana People to People India, and others.

Through my journey, I’ve gained valuable experience in urban greening, community engagement, education, and event organization. I am committed to continuing my efforts to positively impact the environment and society. I am profoundly grateful to the Bank of America for providing a platform that supports my volunteer work and encourages personal and societal growth. The joy of seeing the positive changes in our community—whether it’s a newly planted tree, a student’s progress, or a cleaner beach—fills me with pride and hope for a better future. Together, we can create lasting change and a legacy of compassion and sustainability.












**Volunteer Experience with Nizhal:**

Nizhal, a non-profit trust, promotes environmental conservation and sustainability through community-led initiatives. As a volunteer, I have had the privilege of contributing to the upkeep and development of community urban forests in Chennai. My involvement includes participating in weekly activities such as raising saplings, watering, adding manure, mulching, composting, and seed collection. Our team's dedication to maintaining these parks is exemplary, with regular activities aimed at nurturing and monitoring plant growth, waste management, and developing eco-friendly infrastructure.

Last year, our tree plantation drive made a significant impact, resulting in over 75+ plantations across different locations in Chennai. We have managed to maintain samples at various locations, including:

- **Velachery**: 150+ saplings
- **Taramani**: 180+ saplings
- **Perungudi**: 70+ saplings
- **Kotturpuram**: 2000+ saplings

Kotturpuram, in particular, is a vibrant hub of biodiversity, boasting an impressive 200+ unique species. By planting trees, we are not only creating a better world for ourselves but also making a positive impact on the environment, wildlife, and our community.

Our efforts have led to numerous benefits, including:

- **Regeneration of lost biodiversity**: By planting a diverse range of species, we help restore ecosystems that have been degraded or lost.
- **Creation of habitats for wildlife**: Our urban forests provide shelter and food for various species, including butterflies, birds, and small mammals.
- **Mitigation of the urban heat island effect**: Trees help cool urban areas, reducing the need for air conditioning and improving overall air quality.
- **Educational workshops and nature walks**: We organize events to educate the public about the importance of environmental stewardship and sustainable practices.
- **Support for reforestation efforts and combating deforestation**: By planting trees, we contribute to global efforts to restore forests and prevent further deforestation.
- **Provision of peaceful oases**: Our urban forests offer spaces for recreation, relaxation, and mental well-being.
- **Enhancement of property values and beautification of neighborhoods**: Green spaces improve the aesthetic appeal and value of surrounding areas.
- **Support for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: Our work aligns with global goals for a sustainable and equitable future.
- **Contribution to a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future**: Our ongoing efforts leave a lasting legacy for future generations.

Our vision at Nizhal is to conserve and enhance indigenous tree biodiversity, promoting wellness for habitats and all living communities. Our mission is to foster a greening movement through public-private partnerships and local community involvement.

In 2019, urban forests were credited with reducing air temperatures by up to 4°C in cities, highlighting their critical role in mitigating the urban heat island effect (source: World Economic Forum). Additionally, studies have shown that urban green spaces can reduce stress levels by up to 30% and improve overall mental health (source: American Psychological Association).

Volunteering with Nizhal has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in urban greening, community engagement, and sustainable practices. Over the past two years, I have organized weekly events, engaging over 500 volunteers. Additionally, during a recent cyclone, our team did exceptional work to mitigate the impact and support recovery efforts.

Being part of Nizhal's mission to create a positive impact on the environment and society has been fulfilling. Seeing the smiles on the faces of community members as they enjoy the green spaces we’ve nurtured is heartwarming. Knowing that our efforts contribute to cleaner air, cooler cities, and a healthier planet fills me with pride and hope for the future.

I encourage others to join us in our mission to create a sustainable future for all. Together, we can make a significant difference in promoting environmental conservation and enhancing the quality of life for our communities. Through collective action and unwavering commitment, we can leave a lasting legacy of green, thriving urban forests for future generations to cherish and enjoy.

Each tree planted represents a step towards a healthier and more sustainable future. Engaging in these activities has taught me the value of environmental stewardship and the power of collective action in making a difference.

Apart from these primary activities, I also participate in various other events organized by Chennai Volunteers, which make up the remaining 5% of my volunteer hours, approximately 7.5 hours. These events range from food distribution drives and clothing donations to supporting the elderly and differently-abled individuals.
