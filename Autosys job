Yes, the query will work for 50k–100k records, but performance depends on indexing and execution plan. Here’s how you can optimize it:  

### **Performance Considerations & Optimizations**  

1. **Indexes:**  
   - Ensure indexes exist on common filtering and join columns:  
     ```sql
     CREATE INDEX idx_history ON history (trade_id, trade_date, col_a, col_b, col_c, col_d, col_e, col_f, col_g, col_h, col_i, col_j, col_k, col_l, col_m, col_n, col_o);
     CREATE INDEX idx_initial_stage ON initial_stage (trade_id, trade_date, col_a, col_b, col_c, col_d, col_e, col_f, col_g, col_h, col_i, col_j, col_k, col_l, col_m, col_n, col_o);
     ```
   - Also, index `last_update` to speed up filtering.

2. **Using EXISTS Instead of JOIN:**  
   ```sql
   SELECT h.*
   FROM history h
   WHERE EXISTS (
       SELECT 1
       FROM initial_stage i
       WHERE h.trade_id   = i.trade_id
       AND h.trade_date   = i.trade_date
       AND h.col_a        = i.col_a
       AND h.col_b        = i.col_b
       AND h.col_c        = i.col_c
       AND h.col_d        = i.col_d
       AND h.col_e        = i.col_e
       AND h.col_f        = i.col_f
       AND h.col_g        = i.col_g
       AND h.col_h        = i.col_h
       AND h.col_i        = i.col_i
       AND h.col_j        = i.col_j
       AND h.col_k        = i.col_k
       AND h.col_l        = i.col_l
       AND h.col_m        = i.col_m
       AND h.col_n        = i.col_n
       AND h.col_o        = i.col_o
       AND h.last_update <> i.last_update
   );
   ```
   - `EXISTS` is generally **faster** than `JOIN` because it stops checking as soon as it finds a match.

3. **Partitioning (if applicable)**  
   - If `history` is very large, consider **partitioning by trade_date** for better performance.

### **Testing & Next Steps**  
- Run `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR <query>` to check performance.  
- Try `SELECT COUNT(*)` instead of `SELECT *` to estimate matching records.  
- If this works fine, we can move to the `DELETE` query!





Great teams are built by great people like you! Your collaboration and team spirit make all the difference. Thank you!

Here’s a structured **one-slider template** for your presentation on **Automated SSH Key Management and Communication**:  

---

## **📌 Slide Title:**  
### **Automated SSH Key Management & Communication**  

---

### **🛑 Problem Statement (Current Challenges)**  
- No centralized tracking of SSH keys across servers.  
- Difficult to identify when a key was created or used.  
- No linkage between SSH keys and upstream/downstream systems.  
- Manual monitoring of SSH key expiration leads to security risks.  

---

### **💡 Solution**  
1. **Fetch Server & Application Mapping from MyCTO API**  
   - Retrieve **all servers** and their **upstream/downstream dependencies**.  
2. **Scan Each Server for SSH Key Creation Dates**  
   - Extract key details from `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.  
   - Capture **when the key was created** and **who owns it**.  
3. **Tag Keys with Upstream/Downstream Applications**  
   - Cross-reference with MyCTO API to link each key to relevant applications.  
4. **Automate Expiry Alerts & Key Rotation**  
   - Check if a key is **about to expire** and notify the owner via email.  
   - Schedule automated key **rotation and removal** for security compliance.  

---

### **📈 Productivity Gain & OPEX Impact**  
✅ **Operational Efficiency:** Eliminates manual key tracking.  
✅ **Security Enhancement:** Prevents unauthorized access with expired keys.  
✅ **Reduced Incidents:** Lowers **risk of FCI (Failed Control Incident)** due to compliance breaches.  
✅ **Time Savings:** Automates key management across **100s of servers**, reducing admin effort.  

---

### **🛠 Implementation Requirements**  

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **API Integration** | Fetch server details & dependencies from MyCTO API |
| **Shell Script / Python Script** | Scan SSH keys on all servers & extract metadata |
| **Database (PostgreSQL / MySQL)** | Store key details, creation date, and application mapping |
| **Job Scheduler (Cron / Ansible)** | Automate periodic scanning & email alerts |
| **Email Notification** | Send expiry alerts via SMTP / corporate email service |

---

### **🚀 Next Steps**  
- **Develop API calls** to fetch MyCTO server mappings.  
- **Implement key scanning script** & database storage.  
- **Set up cron jobs** for periodic scans & alerts.  
- **Deploy monitoring dashboard** for SSH key status visibility.

### **Batch Monitoring – Roles & Responsibilities**  

1. **Feeds Data Sanity Checks** – Validate incoming feeds for data quality, format, and completeness.  
2. **Continuous Feed Monitoring** – Track feeds in real-time, escalate delays, and ensure timely ingestion.  
3. **Job Failure Troubleshooting** – Identify root causes, apply fixes, and collaborate for complex issues.  
4. **Stakeholder Communication** – Provide regular updates, send alerts for delays, and document incidents.  

Let me know if you need further refinements!



Here's the refined version of the **Use Case** with the additional detail about the impact of failure to update SSH keys:

---

### **Use Case: Automated SSH Key Management & Communication (Cross-Platform Solution)**

#### **Background:**  
With evolving GIS policies, SSH keys need to be periodically rotated for security compliance. Each application and server requires updated keys to ensure seamless communication between upstream and downstream systems. The manual process of identifying contacts, sending requests for key updates, and following up is tedious, prone to delays, and can trigger vulnerability reports if not updated on time.  

This task becomes even more critical when file transfers or data feeds between servers are dependent on valid SSH keys. Failure to update the keys on time can disrupt the secure transfer of files, leading to delays in critical processes and causing SLA violations.

#### **Challenge:**  
- **Manual Effort:** Identifying application-specific contacts and sending SSH key update requests manually is time-consuming.
- **High Volume:** With thousands of applications, servers, and feeds, tracking key updates manually leads to inefficiencies and missed deadlines.
- **Vulnerability Risks:** Delays in updating SSH keys across servers create security risks and compliance issues.
- **File Transfer Issues:** Failure to update the keys correctly leads to file transfer failures and communication breakdowns between systems, resulting in SLA delays.
- **Lack of Centralized Visibility:** Without an automated system to track SSH key updates, it’s difficult to ensure all servers are compliant and avoid potential issues.

#### **Solution:**  
An **AI-driven or script-based automation** can be implemented to streamline the SSH key update process:

1. **Server and Contact Mapping:**  
   - **Linux Servers:** Access the `/etc/ssh/authorized_keys` file for each server to check the SSH keys and their last update timestamps.
   - **Windows Servers:** Check the `C:\ProgramData\ssh\authorized_keys` file or registry entries for SSH key information.
   - A centralized repository (e.g., CMDB, LDAP, Active Directory) can store mappings of the SSH keys to application owners and their respective contacts.

2. **Automated Key Update Detection:**  
   - Scan both Linux and Windows servers to detect keys that have been newly generated or need updating (comparing the current keys with the latest GIS policy requirements).
   - **For Linux:** Use `ssh-keygen` to check key validity, timestamp, or run a script to ensure keys are encrypted and compliant.
   - **For Windows:** Check the `authorized_keys` file or registry entries for expired or non-compliant keys.
  
3. **Automated Email Communication:**  
   - The system should automatically send emails to the correct contacts based on the server and key information, notifying them to update the SSH keys.
   - Include detailed instructions on how to add the new SSH keys for their respective servers.
   - Track responses to ensure the update is performed within the required time frame.

This is an interesting use case! Here’s how you can structure it for automation:  

### **Use Case: Automated SSH Key Management & Communication**  

#### **Background:**  
With evolving GIS policies, SSH keys need to be periodically rotated for security compliance. Each application and server requires updated keys to ensure seamless communication between upstream and downstream systems. The manual process of identifying correct contacts, sending emails, and following up is tedious, prone to delays, and can trigger vulnerability reports if not updated on time.  

#### **Challenge:**  
- **Manual Effort:** Identifying application-specific contacts and sending SSH key updates is time-consuming.  
- **High Volume:** With thousands of applications, servers, and feeds, tracking key updates manually leads to inefficiencies.  
- **Vulnerability Risks:** Delays in updating SSH keys increase security risks and can lead to compliance violations.  
- **Lack of Centralized Tracking:** No automated way to verify which servers have updated keys, making follow-ups difficult.  

#### **Solution:**  
An **AI-driven or script-based automation** can be implemented to streamline the SSH key update process:  

1. **Server & Contact Mapping:**  
   - Extract authorized SSH key files from servers.  
   - Map keys to application owners and authorized contacts (assuming this data exists in a central repository like a CMDB or LDAP).  

2. **Automated Notification & Tracking:**  
   - Identify which keys were newly generated and which require updates.  
   - Auto-generate email notifications to the respective application teams with SSH key update instructions.  
   - Track responses and follow-ups to ensure updates are completed within SLA.  

3. **Compliance & Vulnerability Management:**  
   - Periodic scanning of authorized key files to detect outdated or unapproved keys.  
   - Automated alerts for missing or delayed updates.  
   - Dashboard for tracking compliance status of SSH key updates across all applications.  

Would you like a **Python script** to start with this automation (e.g., parsing authorized SSH key files, identifying owners, and auto-generating emails)? Or do you need a design document for a full-fledged system?





Here's the refined version with a more realistic background:  

### **Background:**  
Most applications rely on job scheduling tools like AutoSys, Quartz, ITRS, and Dynatrace to execute critical business processes. These jobs handle everything from data processing and report generation to financial transactions and system updates. Each application team is responsible for monitoring and troubleshooting job failures, ensuring minimal disruption to business operations.  

When a job fails, teams must manually check logs, identify the root cause, and apply a fix. With multiple jobs running across different environments and dependencies on upstream systems, troubleshooting can become complex and time-consuming. Failures often occur unexpectedly, and a delayed response can lead to SLA breaches, impacting business continuity.  

### **Challenge:**  
Job failures occur due to various reasons, including:  
- **Infrastructure Load or Failures:** High system load, resource contention, or unexpected hardware malfunctions.  
- **Incorrect Records from Upstream Feeds:** Bad data input leading to validation failures or processing errors.  
- **Delays from Upstream Systems:** Missed dependencies or timeouts impacting job execution.  
- **Database Locking & Deadlocks:** Concurrent transactions causing job failures.  
- **Network Issues:** Connectivity problems between application servers, databases, or external systems.  
- **Configuration & Code Issues:** Incorrect job parameters, environment mismatches, or code defects.  

Manually identifying and resolving these failures is time-consuming and inefficient, leading to:  
- **Delayed Incident Response:** Increasing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR).  
- **Operational Bottlenecks:** Teams spend significant effort on repetitive troubleshooting.  
- **High Alert Fatigue:** Too many job failure notifications, making it difficult to focus on critical incidents.  
- **SLA Risks:** Delays impacting business-critical processes and regulatory compliance.  

### **Solution:**  
AI-driven proactive failure management can enhance job monitoring and resolution by:  
- **Predicting Failures Before They Occur:** AI models analyze historical job patterns to forecast potential failures and take preventive actions.  
- **Automating Log Analysis:** NLP-based tools extract failure patterns from logs, reducing manual effort in root cause analysis.  
- **Anomaly Detection & Prioritization:** AI categorizes job failures based on impact, ensuring critical issues receive immediate attention.  
- **Self-Healing Mechanisms:** Automated workflows trigger predefined recovery steps for recurring failures.  
- **Centralized Insights & Collaboration:** A unified AI-driven monitoring system provides real-time failure trends, enabling teams to collaborate effectively.  

By leveraging AI, teams can transition from reactive troubleshooting to proactive failure prevention, improving efficiency, reducing downtime, and enhancing overall system reliability.

**Subject:** Query Execution Timing & Vertica Read-Only Access  

Hi Sunder,  

The query can be executed anytime after 5 AM EST, considering the Insight flow would be completed by then. If they plan to pull data for more than two years, please inform us in advance so we can monitor the database performance. Based on our experience over the years, we do not anticipate any issues.  

Additionally, if I recall correctly, during a similar discussion around 2016, Vikram Gupta provided your team with **read-only** access to the Vertica database for report execution. Upon reviewing the current read-only access, I found that only Nick, Bikas, and yourself have it. Would it be possible to extend this access to your team so they can run the reports independently?  

Let me know your thoughts.  

Best regards,

**The Impact of My Volunteer Work**

As a dedicated volunteer, I am deeply proud and fulfilled by the meaningful impact I've made since joining the bank in 2020. Initially, I engaged in virtual volunteering due to pandemic restrictions, which ignited a strong desire to make a difference. After relocating to Chennai, I shifted to on-field events, focusing on tree plantation drives, supporting special kids, and assisting senior citizens.

My work with Nizhal, a non-profit trust, has been especially rewarding. Weekly, I participate in activities at Nizhal Tree Park, including gardening, cleaning, watering trees, and managing waste. These efforts help maintain green spaces that enhance the environment and provide a sanctuary for the community.

I have also led teams in mapping vulnerable areas through Missing Maps, which helps humanitarian organizations deliver aid more effectively in crisis situations. This critical work ensures that those in need receive timely assistance.

In addition to environmental efforts, I have made a positive impact in education. I’ve provided scribe services for visually impaired students, offering support with exams and assignments, and have also offered career guidance, created educational materials, and taught subjects like math to children. My support extends to events for persons with disabilities, promoting their empowerment and inclusion.

My contributions to community development include beach cleanups, visiting old age homes, and distributing school supplies. I’ve also assisted underprivileged students with resume preparation, communication skills training, mock interviews, and career exploration.

**Volunteer Experience with Nizhal:**

Nizhal, a non-profit trust, promotes environmental conservation and sustainability through community-led initiatives. As a volunteer, I have had the privilege of contributing to the upkeep and development of community urban forests in Chennai. My involvement includes participating in weekly activities such as raising saplings, watering, adding manure, mulching, composting, and seed collection. Our team's dedication to maintaining these parks is exemplary, with regular activities aimed at nurturing and monitoring plant growth, waste management, and developing eco-friendly infrastructure.

Last year, our tree plantation drive made a significant impact, resulting in over 75+ plantations across different locations in Chennai. We have managed to maintain samples at various locations, including:

- **Velachery**: 150+ saplings
- **Taramani**: 180+ saplings
- **Perungudi**: 70+ saplings
- **Kotturpuram**: 2000+ saplings

Kotturpuram, in particular, is a vibrant hub of biodiversity, boasting an impressive 200+ unique species. By planting trees, we are not only creating a better world for ourselves but also making a positive impact on the environment, wildlife, and our community.

Our efforts have led to numerous benefits, including:

- **Regeneration of lost biodiversity**: By planting a diverse range of species, we help restore ecosystems that have been degraded or lost.
- **Creation of habitats for wildlife**: Our urban forests provide shelter and food for various species, including butterflies, birds, and small mammals.
- **Mitigation of the urban heat island effect**: Trees help cool urban areas, reducing the need for air conditioning and improving overall air quality.
- **Educational workshops and nature walks**: We organize events to educate the public about the importance of environmental stewardship and sustainable practices.
- **Support for reforestation efforts and combating deforestation**: By planting trees, we contribute to global efforts to restore forests and prevent further deforestation.
- **Provision of peaceful oases**: Our urban forests offer spaces for recreation, relaxation, and mental well-being.
- **Enhancement of property values and beautification of neighborhoods**: Green spaces improve the aesthetic appeal and value of surrounding areas.
- **Support for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**: Our work aligns with global goals for a sustainable and equitable future.
- **Contribution to a greener, healthier, and more sustainable future**: Our ongoing efforts leave a lasting legacy for future generations.

Our vision at Nizhal is to conserve and enhance indigenous tree biodiversity, promoting wellness for habitats and all living communities. Our mission is to foster a greening movement through public-private partnerships and local community involvement.

In 2019, urban forests were credited with reducing air temperatures by up to 4°C in cities, highlighting their critical role in mitigating the urban heat island effect (source: World Economic Forum). Additionally, studies have shown that urban green spaces can reduce stress levels by up to 30% and improve overall mental health (source: American Psychological Association).

Volunteering with Nizhal has been an incredibly rewarding experience. It has allowed me to gain hands-on experience in urban greening, community engagement, and sustainable practices. Over the past two years, I have organized weekly events, engaging over 500 volunteers. Additionally, during a recent cyclone, our team did exceptional work to mitigate the impact and support recovery efforts.

Being part of Nizhal's mission to create a positive impact on the environment and society has been fulfilling. Seeing the smiles on the faces of community members as they enjoy the green spaces we’ve nurtured is heartwarming.

Volunteering with Chennai Volunteers has been a deeply rewarding experience that has enriched my life in many ways. Over the past two years, I have dedicated more than 150 hours to various activities organized by this impactful nonprofit organization. My volunteer work is split into different areas, with 70% of my time devoted to teaching school students and the remaining 30% focused on environmental efforts such as beach clean-ups and tree plantation drives.

Primarily, I focus on teaching school students from three different locations, providing them with academic support and mentorship. This role involves not only helping them with their studies but also inspiring them to develop essential life skills. Working with these children, often from underprivileged backgrounds, has been incredibly fulfilling. I have seen firsthand how education can transform lives and open up new opportunities. The joy of watching a student grasp a difficult concept or express newfound confidence is immeasurable. This 70% of my volunteer time, roughly 105 hours, is dedicated to making a positive impact on the educational journey of these young minds.

In addition to teaching, I have devoted approximately 25% of my volunteer hours, around 37.5 hours, to participating in beach clean-up drives and other environmental activities. These efforts are crucial in promoting environmental awareness and sustainability within the community. Beach clean-ups involve collective efforts to remove litter and pollutants from our shores, preserving marine life and maintaining the beauty of our natural habitats. These events are not only about cleaning up the environment but also about educating the community on the importance of reducing waste and protecting our planet.

Tree plantation drives are another significant part of my environmental volunteering. Planting trees helps to enhance green cover, combat climate change, and improve air quality. Each tree planted represents a step towards a healthier and more sustainable future. Engaging in these activities has taught me the value of environmental stewardship and the power of collective action in making a difference.

Apart from these primary activities, I also participate in various other events organized by Chennai Volunteers, which make up the remaining 5% of my volunteer hours, approximately 7.5 hours. These events range from food distribution drives and clothing donations to supporting the elderly and differently-abled individuals. Each of these initiatives addresses different social issues and contributes to the overall well-being of our community.

My experience with Chennai Volunteers has been incredibly diverse and enriching. The organization’s mission to bridge the gap between those willing to help and those in need resonates deeply with me. Being part of a community that is dedicated to making a positive impact has been inspiring and motivating. The collaborative environment created by Chennai Volunteers allows volunteers like me to contribute our time, skills, and resources effectively, knowing that our efforts are making a tangible difference.

Through my involvement with Chennai Volunteers, I have learned the importance of empathy, compassion, and social responsibility. Each volunteer opportunity has provided me with valuable insights and experiences, enhancing my understanding of the challenges faced by different communities and the ways in which we can address them. Whether it’s through education, environmental conservation, or community welfare, every hour spent volunteering has been a step towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society.

In conclusion, volunteering with Chennai Volunteers has been a profoundly impactful journey. With over 150 hours dedicated to teaching, environmental activities, and various other community service initiatives, I have had the privilege of contributing to meaningful change. The experiences and lessons learned through this journey have not only enriched my life but also reinforced my commitment to continuing my efforts towards a better and more equitable world.
