Thank you for joining us today for our Missing Maps event. My name is [Your Name], and I'm excited to welcome you all. Missing Maps is a collaborative project where volunteers like us help map the most vulnerable places in the developing world. By digitizing satellite images and adding features like buildings and roads to OpenStreetMap, we provide crucial data that humanitarian organizations use to respond to crises effectively.

Your efforts today will help save lives and improve living conditions in disaster-prone and remote regions. Whether you're new or experienced, your contribution is incredibly valuable. Thank you for being here and making a difference with us. Let's get started!
